### **Marginal Pruduct**
The change in output resulting from employing one more unit of a particular input.

### **Perfect Competition**
There is a set of market conditions which are assumed to prevail in the discussion of what perfect competition might be if it were theoretically possible to ever obtain such perfect market conditions. These conditions include:

- **A large number of buyers and sellers** – A large number of consumers with the willingness and ability to buy the product at a certain price, and a large number of producers with the willingness and ability to supply the product at a certain price. As a result, individuals are unable to influence prices more than a little.
- **Anti-competitive regulation**: It is assumed that a market of perfect competition shall provide the regulations and protections implicit in the control of and elimination of anti-competitive activity in the market place.
- **Every participant is a price taker**: No participant with market power to set prices.
- **Homogeneous products**: The products are perfect substitutes for each other (i.e., the qualities and characteristics of a market good or service do not vary between different suppliers). There are many instances in which there exist "similar" products that are close substitutes (such as butter and margarine), which are relatively easily interchangeable, so that a rise in the price of one good will cause a significant shift to the consumption of the close substitute. If the cost of changing a firm's manufacturing process to produce the substitute is also relatively "immaterial" in relationship to the firm's overall profit and cost, this is sufficient to ensure that an economic situation isn't significantly different from a perfectly competitive economic market.[7]
- **Rational buyers**: Buyers make all trades that increase their economic utility and make no trades that do not.
- **No barriers to entry or exit**: This implies that both entry and exit must be perfectly free of sunk costs.
- **No externalities**: Costs or benefits of an activity do not affect third parties. This criterion also excludes any government intervention.
- **Non-increasing returns to scale and no network effects**: The lack of economies of scale or network effects ensures that there will always be a sufficient number of firms in the industry.
- **Perfect factor mobility**: In the long run factors of production are perfectly mobile, allowing free long term adjustments to changing market conditions. This allows workers to freely move between firms.[8]
- **Perfect information**: All consumers and producers know all prices of products and utilities they would get from owning each product. This prevents firms from obtaining any information which would give them a competitive edge.[8]
- **Profit maximization of sellers**: Firms sell where the most profit is generated, where marginal costs meet marginal revenue.
- **Well defined property rights**: These determine what may be sold, as well as what rights are conferred on the buyer.
- **Zero transaction costs**: Buyers and sellers do not incur costs in making an exchange of goods.

如果市场中的买者和卖者规模足够大，并且每个个人（包括买者和卖者）都是价格接受者，而且不能单独影响市场价格时，这样的竞争性状态被称为完全竞争。同时，也称这样的市场为“完全竞争市场”（perfect market）。

更加详细地解释，完全竞争指在市场上的产品皆同质，且信息为完全流通，生产者能自由进出市场，以及拥有较低的交易成本和时间差。

### **Pareto Optimum**
A situation where no individual or preference criterion can be made better off without making at least one individual or preference criterion worse off.

In theoretical models where conditions of perfect competition hold, it has been demonstrated that a market will reach an equilibrium in which the quantity supplied for every product or service, including labor, equals the quantity demanded at the current price. This equilibrium would be a Pareto optimum.

帕累托最优是指资源分配的一种理想状态。给定固有的一群人和可分配的资源，如果从一种分配状态到另一种状态的变化中，在没有使任何人情况变坏的前提下，使得至少一个人变得更好，这就是帕累托改善。帕累托最适的状态就是不可能再有更多的帕雷托改善的状态；换句话说，不可能在不使任何其他人受损的情况下再改善某些人的情况。

### **Marginal Rate of Substitution**
The rate at which a consumer can give up some amount of one good in exchange for another good while maintaining the same level of utility.

在甲乙两种商品组合及保持效用不变的条件下，消费者每得到额外一单位商品甲之后要而必须放弃的商品乙的数量。

### **Marginal rate of technical substitution**
The amount by which the quantity of one input has to be reduced ($-\Delta x_{2}$) when one extra unit of another input is used ($\Delta x_{1}=1$), so that output remains constant ($y={\bar  {y}}$).

### **Elasticity of Substitution**
The ratio of percentage change in capital-labour ratio with the percentage change in Marginal Rate of Technical Substitution.

效用保持不变的情况下，边际替代率的百分比变动引起的商品比值的百分比变动大小。

### **Return to Scale**
